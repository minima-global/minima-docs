### Maxima Overview

Minima runs below a fast and scalable Peer-to-Peer (P2P) layer 2 network called Maxima. On Maxima, users can transmit any data they like, not just Minima transactions, to other individual Maxima users. Users of Maxima who have no Minima, no tokens and send no transactions, can still help to secure the network, by sending messages over Maxima and undergoing the Proof of Work required for doing so â€” thereby securing the Minima network as a collective whole.
