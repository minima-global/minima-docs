### The Maxima Layer

All off-chain transactions occur on layer 2, known as Maxima, where the bulk of peer-to-peer exchange between users of the network takes place. This is faster, because users of layer 2 only need to process their own transactions, instead of processing the entire network's transactions, as occurs on layer 1. For this reason, Layer 2 scales, while layer 1 does not.

#### Maxima Key Uses

+ Peer-to-peer transacting layer
+ Operational level for any number of transaction
+ Maxima is fast and scalable
