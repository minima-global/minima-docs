### Maxima Nodes

Maxima nodes are run by users who are incentivised to set up Maxima routers, effectively a node with an external IP, that other Minima users can easily access. Since Maxima nodes allow the transfer of small amounts of data for free, aside from the required Proof of Work needed for them to be sent, it is possible for them to charge for larger amounts of data that users wish to send. This is realised in the form of a fee in the form of Minima coins, that is paid to the Maxima node who has routed a user's message.
Consequently, as increasing amounts of large data are sent over Maxima, users of Minima are increasingly incentivised to set up better Maxima routers to meet the demand for the network traffic. Ultimately, providing a positive feedback loop that improves the integrity and quality of Maximaâ€™s peer-to-peer network over time.

Minimal technical knowledge is required to run a Maxima node, find out how to do so here.
