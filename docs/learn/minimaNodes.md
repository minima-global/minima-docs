### Minima Nodes

Every Minima user runs a Complete Minima node by default, once they download the Minima app. ‘Complete’ refers to the fact that all Minima nodes both construct and validate the Minima chain. Such protocol design is novel and immensely powerful, as it ensures all network participants must agree on any protocol modification before it is implemented, meaning forks of Minima are highly improbable. Together Minima nodes create a secure value transfer layer for transactions on the Minima network.

There is no technical knowledge or specialised hardware required to run a Minima node. Simply by downloading the Minima app and letting it run in the background, users help grow and secure the Minima network, while consuming no more energy than a regular messaging app.
