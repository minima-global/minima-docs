### What are MiniDapps?

MiniDapps are decentralised applications that run on the Minima network. Users host them locally on an Android device and use them as they would a traditional app. They can be designed in the same way traditional web apps are, using simple web-native coding languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. This allows developers to leverage the power of smart contracts on the Minima blockchain whilst using a build environment which is familiar.
