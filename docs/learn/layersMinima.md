### The Minima Layer

All on-chain transactions occur on layer 1, known as Minima, where users of the network collaborate to secure the chain, removing the need for centralised miners. Users should only be using layer 1 if they need to begin a transacting relationship, end a transacting relationship or dispute a transaction that has occurred on layer 2. The layer essentially acts as a layer of trust for users, where all transactions are accounted for.

#### Minima Key Uses

+ Setting up a transacting relationship
+ Starting and completing a transaction
+ End settlement and conflict resolution
+ Security
