### Why Distinct Layers?

Layer 1 does not scale, whereas layer 2 does. Scalability relates to the number of transactions per second that a layer can process. On Layer 1 there is an upper bound on the number of possible transactions per second. But on Layer 2, there is no limit. These differentiated layers helps reduce transaction fees and increase transaction throughput.

For example, by removing computation from Layer 2, where the majority of exchange between peers takes place, Maxima enables users to transact instantly with each other. Users only pay a fee, in the form of proof of work (PoW), when they decide to start, end or dispute a transaction. This ensures Minima as a collective whole can scale, to process a large number of transactions without bloating the network, thereby avoiding high fees (in the form of the Burn), and long waiting times for users.

Traditionally on PoW chains, high fees are used to pay miners to compensate for traffic that is taken off layer 1, or the supply is increased each year to pay miners. Both of these models work, but neither is optimal. Since either average users cannot afford to use the chain once it becomes expensive, or the chain is forced to sacrifice its fixed supply, removing its ability to become a long term Store of Value proposition.
