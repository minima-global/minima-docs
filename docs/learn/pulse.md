### Pulse

Using a mechanism known as the Pulse, all Layer 2 users secure the base layer by providing PoW to the chain. The Pulse is information that all Maxima users must process on the peer-to-peer Maxima network in order to replace the fee-based security model with a PoW-based model. When you combine the two layers of the protocol you end up with an immensely powerful architecture that can scale to meet the needs of any number of users on the network, without compromising with high fees, slow processing times or needing to inflate the supply.
