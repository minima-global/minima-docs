### Burn Summary

Provides a strong incentive for users to propagate and process transactions, since doing so reduces the overall supply of Minima coins created at genesis (1 billion coins), making existing coins more scarce and thus more valuable.
Order transactions based on the value of the burn for individual transactions, which acts as a method to regulate on-chain traffic.  
Create a mechanism for spam prevention by making DDoS attacks expensive, by forcing network actors to incur a cost for every transaction sent, making malicious attempts to spam the network expensive.
