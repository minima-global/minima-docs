### The Purpose of the Burn

The Burn is used in a similar way to a fee model on other blockchain protocols, to order transactions and regulate on-chain traffic. Although, unlike fees, the Burn has no minimum value, since there is no requirement for the total Burn to be large enough to support the type of mining industry that exists on other Proof of Work protocols.

The Burn is likely to be high during periods of heavy traffic or spam, and as it rises,  traffic will decrease, and the system will self-regulate. The burn can be very low when traffic is at manageable levels as the total amount is not important, only the relative burn amounts in comparison to other transactions are.
