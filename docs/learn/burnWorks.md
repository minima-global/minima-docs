### How the Burn Works

The level of Burn employed is determined by the level of network traffic and exists as a value relative to all other transactions on the network. 'Burnt' coins are removed from Minima's hard-capped supply, thereby maintaining a deflationary model that increases the scarcity and thus the value of the remaining MInima coins in circulation over time.
