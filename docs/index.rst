Minima is a wholly decentralised, mobile-first, quantum secure cryptocurrency. There are no miners and no database that grows indefinitely. It features a simple yet powerful scripting language, adaptive block scaling, and an innovative proof of work consensus protocol featuring a cascading proof blockchain secured by a user-centric algorithm that uses both on-chain and off-chain traffic. Everyone runs a complete node. Forever.

Minima.js makes it possible to access the Minima blockchain and build fully-featured distributed applications that take advantage of Minima's endless possibilities.
