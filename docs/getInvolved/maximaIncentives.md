### Maxima Incentives

For anyone who wants to contribute more than simply running a Minima node, there is also the opportunity to run a Maxima node. By running a Maxima node, users will be helping build our layer 2 infrastructure, which will enable users to route transactions peer-to-peer on the Minima network. Minimal technical knowledge is required to run a Maxima node, you must simply know how to set up a server to create an external IP.

#### Earn Minima coins for your work

We are providing additional rewards for those who run a Maxima node, in the form of Minima Coins, which will be redeemable via the Minima app at Mainnet launch. To get started, and earn coins for your work, please follow the instructions below.

Once the Minima Mainnet is live in Q4 of 2021, those who run a Maxima node will also be able to earn a fee in the form of Minima coins for routing transactions over the peer-to-peer network that Maxima creates.
