### Build a MiniDap

To create utility for the users on our network, we are looking for developers to build decentralised applications, known as MiniDapps.

#### What are MiniDapps?

MiniDapps are decentralised applications that run on the Minima network, that users host locally on an Android device, and use as they would a traditional app. They can be built using web-native coding languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS, and provide an accessible front-end to smart contracts on the Minima network. Such smart contracts allow for tokens to be automatically managed by a rule set that can be defined to meet the requirements of a specific use case.

#### Earn Minima Coins for Your Work

We are providing rewards for those who build MiniDapps, in the form of Minima Coins, which will be redeemable via the Minima app at Mainnet launch. To get started, and earn coins for your work, please follow the instructions below.

#### Example Minidapps

The following MiniDapps are good examples of what can be built on Minima, and are available to view when you download the app via Storefront.
