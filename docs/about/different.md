## How is Minima Different?

While other blockchain protocols have traded decentralisation for scalability and security, Minimaâ€™s architecture was designed with decentralisation as its primary feature. Since, if one approaches the blockchain trilemma from first principles, it becomes clear that the only way for all three properties to exist in union, is if true decentralisation can first be achieved. The scalability and security of a blockchain, ultimately, become emergent outcomes of such a truly decentralised system.
