### What is Minima?

Minima is a secure, scalable and truly decentralised cryptocurrency that has a hard-capped supply of a billion coins. Its chain is designed to use a small amount of resources and be compact in size, so that it can run continuously and completely on a mobile device, without consequence to its user. This ensures every user on the network is equal, as all users can run Minima in the same way, all the time. Third parties in such a system become redundant, as no critical aspects of the network need to be outsourced to specialised user classes at all. Meaning centralisation becomes not just undesirable, but impossible to achieve altogether.
