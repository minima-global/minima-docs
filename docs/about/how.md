## How Does it Work?

The foundation to understanding Minima, is knowing that every user of the Minima network runs a Minima node by default, which both validates and constructs the base layer, via a mobile application that is compact in size and accessible to use. At first glance, this may seem like a relatively trivial piece of information, yet it is the core of what makes Minima so powerful. This novel design allows the Minima protocol to be adopted and thus secured by a substantial number of users, simply because it is easy to use.
