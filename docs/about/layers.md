## Layers to Scale From Inception

The final key feature to understand is that the Minima protocol will consist of two distinct layers at Mainnet launch. Layer 1, known as Minima, is the base verification layer of the protocol (secured by all users as discussed above), while Layer 2, known as Maxima, is the transactional layer. Having these differentiated layers, enables the reduction of transaction fees while increasing processing speed on the network as a collective whole.
