### Every Minima User is Equal

Having all network participants run a Minima node by default ensures that every Minima user is equal on the network, meaning there is no need for any user to rely on another to validate or secure the base layer of the Minima chain for them. All roles are the direct responsibility of every user and completed simply by letting the Minima app run in the background. This is key, since it allows for a truly decentralised network of equal nodes with full network responsibilities to finally be achieved in a blockchain system.
